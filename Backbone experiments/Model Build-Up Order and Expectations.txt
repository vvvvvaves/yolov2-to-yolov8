Darknet-19: version from the paper (No techniques used but a large model)
Expectations: baseline

YOLOv8s-cls Version 1: Bare model (No techniques used and a considerably smaller model)
Expectations: worse accuracy, faster inference time

YOLOv8s-cls Version 2: Version 1 + Residual Connections in Bottlenecks (V1 + Enhanced gradient flow)
Expectations: bigger gradients, shorter gradient path, better accuracy

YOLOv8s-cls Version 3: Version 2 + CSP in C2f (V2 + Reduced computational complexity, Enhanced gradient flow)
Expectations: bigger gradients, shorter gradient path, faster inference, less parameters in a model, less memory needed, better accuracy

YOLOv8s-cls Version 4: Version 3 + concatenation-based skip connections of hidden outputs in C2f (V3 + feature reusability)
Expectations: better accuracy with minimal additional parameters, might be slightly slower

YOLOv8s-cls Version 5: Version 4 + Linear layer in classification head
Expectations: larger model, larger inference time, better accuracy (?)
